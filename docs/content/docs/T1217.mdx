## Description from ATT&CK

Adversaries may enumerate information about browsers to learn more about compromised environments. Data saved by browsers (such as bookmarks, accounts, and browsing history) may reveal a variety of personal information about users (e.g., banking sites, relationships/interests, social media, etc.) as well as details about internal network resources such as servers, tools/dashboards, or other related infrastructure.(Citation: Kaspersky Autofill)

Browser information may also highlight additional targets after an adversary has access to valid credentials, especially [Credentials In Files](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/001) associated with logins cached by a browser.

Specific storage locations vary based on platform and/or application, but browser information is typically stored in local files and databases (e.g., `%APPDATA%/Google/Chrome`).(Citation: Chrome Roaming Profiles)

## Tests

### Test #1 - Capture currently opened Safari URL

Adversaries use osascript to gather information about the victim's browsing habits and preferences.

```applescript tab="<Code /> Script"
tell application "safari"
  set curURL to URL in front document
  return curURL
end tell
```
```bash tab="<Terminal /> Execution"
osascript -e 'tell application "safari"' -e 'set curURL to URL in front document' -e 'return curURL' -e 'end tell'
```

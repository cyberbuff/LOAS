## Description from ATT&CK



Adversaries may clear artifacts associated with previously established persistence on a host system to remove evidence of their activity. This may involve various actions, such as removing services, deleting executables, [Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112), [Plist File Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1647), or other methods of cleanup to prevent defenders from collecting evidence of their persistent presence.(Citation: Cylance Dust Storm) Adversaries may also delete accounts previously created to maintain persistence (i.e. [Create Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136)).(Citation: Talos - Cisco Attack 2022)

In some instances, artifacts of persistence may also be removed once an adversary’s persistence is executed in order to prevent errors with the new instance of the malware.(Citation: NCC Group Team9 June 2020)


## Atomic Tests

### Atomic Test #1 - Delete a login item

Removes a specified login item from the user's login items list. This can be used to clean up persistence mechanisms or remove unwanted autostart entries.

|----------|------|---------------|
| loginItemName | str | `Calculator` |


```applescript tab="<Code /> Script"
tell application "System Events" to delete login item "Calculator"

```


```bash tab="<Terminal /> Execution"
# Execute with default arguments
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to delete login item "Calculator"'

# Or save to file and execute

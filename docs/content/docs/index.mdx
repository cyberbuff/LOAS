<b>L</b>iving off the <b>O</b>rchard: <b>A</b>pple <b>S</b>cript is designed to
provide detailed information on various scripts(AppleScript, JXA) and how they
are being used by threat actors for malicious purposes.

## Executing Apple Script

This project provides multiple ways to execute Apple Script. You can execute it via CLI, osascript, Swift, Applet, or run the binary directly.

These execution methods are documented in the [Red Canary Threat Detection Report](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/techniques/applescript/). Much of the work was done by them and this documentation expands on it.

The [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/cyberbuff/loas/releases/latest) provides all of these different files for each test.

<Folder name="releases" defaultOpen>
  <File name="get_clipboard_content_using_applescript_defaults.scpt" />
  <File name="get_clipboard_content_using_applescript_defaults.swift" />
  <File name="get_clipboard_content_using_applescript_defaults.app.zip" />
  <File name="get_clipboard_content_using_applescript_defaults" />
</Folder>

If you would like to compile the files yourself, install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and then use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyberbuff/loas.git
cd loas
uv sync
uv run main.py build
```

Each of these methods generate different set of logs based on the execution tool.

The below sample Endpoint Security logs are gathered using [Mac Monitor](https://github.com/Brandon7CC/mac-monitor/) for each of the execution methods for getting the clipboard content.

### osascript CLI

This is the simplest way to execute commands from this repository.

```bash
osascript -e "the clipboard"
```

### Script

Download the script from the [releases page](https://github.com/cyberbuff/loas/releases/latest) and execute it with osascript.

```bash
osascript get_clipboard_content_using_applescript_defaults.scpt
```

### Swift

Download the Swift file from the [releases page](https://github.com/cyberbuff/loas/releases/latest) and execute it with Swift.

Note: You might need to install XCode Developer Tools to run Swift files.

```bash
swift get_clipboard_content_using_applescript_defaults.swift
```

### Applet

Download the `.app` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/cyberbuff/loas/releases/latest) and execute it.

```bash
open -n get_clipboard_content_using_applescript_defaults.app
```

<img alt="App" src="/images/app.png" />

### Binary

Download the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/cyberbuff/loas/releases/latest) and execute it.

```bash
./get_clipboard_content_using_applescript_defaults
```

This project provides multiple ways to execute Apple Script. You can execute it via CLI, osascript, Swift, App Bundle or run the binary directly.

The [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/cyberbuff/loas/releases/latest) provides all of these different files for each test.

<Folder name="releases" defaultOpen>
  <File name="get_user_using_system_info.scpt" />
  <File name="get_user_using_system_info.swift" />
  <File name="get_user_using_system_info.app.zip" />
  <File name="get_user_using_system_info" />
</Folder>


If you would like to compile the files yourself, you can use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyberbuff/loas.git
cd loas
uv sync
uv run main.py build
```

Each of these methods generate different set of logs based on the execution tool.
From what I could find in Sigma rules, Elastic Detection Rules, and Splunk Detection rules, they mostly check only for osascript CLI.

TODO: Add some stats here on how many detections are there for each of the methods.

I used [Red Canary Mac Monitor](https://github.com/redcanaryco/mac-monitor/) to gather the Endpoint Security logs for each of the methods for getting the clipboard content.


## CLI

This is the simplest way to execute commands from this repository.

```bash
osascript -e "return (the clipboard)"
```

## osascript

Download the script from the [releases page](https://github.com/loas-project/loas/releases) and execute it with osascript.

```bash
osascript get_clipboard_content_using_applescript_defaults.scpt
```

## Swift

Download the Swift file from the [releases page](https://github.com/loas-project/loas/releases) and execute it with Swift.

Note: You might need to install XCode Developer Tools to run Swift files.

```bash
swift get_clipboard_content_using_applescript_defaults.swift
```
<img alt="Swift" src="/images/swift.png" />
## App Bundle

Download the `.app` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/loas-project/loas/releases) and execute it.

```bash
open -n get_clipboard_content_using_applescript_defaults.app
```

<img alt="App" src="/images/app.png" />
## Binary

Download the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/loas-project/loas/releases) and execute it.

```bash
./get_clipboard_content_using_applescript_defaults
```
